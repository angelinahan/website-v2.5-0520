        <p>
          An immersive web experience created for my Experience and Interaction
          class final project. As an avid nature lover, I created a site that
          plays soothing nature videos and sounds while guiding you through
          meditation. Part choose-your-own-adventure game, part mindfulness
          break, Desktop Mindfulness is designed for students and office workers
          to take a quick break from their busy lives with some calming natural
          scenery.
        </p>
        <p class="attr-category">INSPIRATION</p>
        <p>
          I originally thought of the idea for this site in April 2019, after a
          long winter spent cooped up in my tiny dorm room in the city. Growing
          up in a small suburban town in New Jersey, I was used to having more
          access to nature, and I wanted to bring a little bit of that
          experience to my new life in the city. I was inspired by The Quiet
          Place Project to make Desktop Mindfulness completely immersive, with a
          full-screen video and audio, as well as user-driven, with controls to
          enable them to choose their own path through the app. When COVID-19
          hit in 2020, this site felt even more relevant, as many of us were
          forced inside under shelter-in-place orders and unable to travel to
          enjoy nature. It is my hope that this site brought some joy, relief,
          and relaxation to its users.
        </p>
        <p class="attr-category">CHALLENGES OF SCALING UP</p>
        <p>
          In December 2020, Desktop Mindfulness was featured in several
          newsletters with national reach, bringing many more visitors than I
          had ever planned for to my site. Previously, the site were being
          served from a remote a storage bucket, but with the large size of the
          videos and increasing traffic, the costs of storage rose quickly and I
          had to take down the site temporarily in order to research ways to
          scale up the site in a sustainable way. After looking into possible
          solutions, I decided to rewrite the project as a single-page
          application in React for better code reuse and organization.
          Additionally, I began serving the videos using the Pexels API, rather
          than hosting them myself. These changes lowered the cost of hosting
          the site, allowing me to put it back online as a free experience for
          everyone to use. As of October 2021, the site has been used by 180
          people in over 20 countries, and I'm excited for more people worldwide
          to discover this pocket of nature on the internet.
