            <p>
                The idea for this project stemmed from a conversation I had with a friend about art supplies. 
                Despite hating using charcoal in our artwork, we somehow both ended up owning multipacks of charcoal 
                that we were never going to use again, yet couldn't bear to throw away. We'd bought this charcoal, 
                along with other required supplies, for an art class we took freshman year, and used it a few times in class. 
                The charcoal came in packs of several sticks, and most of the package remained untouched. My friend and I were 
                disappointed at how wasteful our art supply buying habits were. Art supplies can be quite expensive, and we'd 
                shelled out in order to do our best work in the class. However, after the class ended, we were left with extra 
                art supplies that we didn't need and didn't want to store.</p>
<p>
                After our conversation, I couldn't stop thinking that there must be a better way to deal 
                with art supplies at the end of a semester besides hoarding them or getting rid of them. artcycle was created 
                to answer this question: <b>How can we provide college students with a platform to pass gently-used art supplies 
                    on to others who need them, in order to save money, reduce waste, and minimize the need to store art supplies in small dorm rooms?</b>
